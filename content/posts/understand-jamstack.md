The name is partly acronymic: the "JAM" in JAMstack stands for "Javascript," "APIs" and "Markup," and the concept introduces a new way to think about static sites and how to serve output to users making requests on the front end. The idea is to have a completely static front end that is delivered to users, but with some data being supplied by APIs.
